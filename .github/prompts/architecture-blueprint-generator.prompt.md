## Generated Prompt

"Create a comprehensive 'Project_Architecture_Blueprint.md' document that thoroughly analyzes the architectural patterns in the codebase to serve as a definitive reference for maintaining architectural consistency. Use the following approach:

### 1. Architecture Detection and Analysis
- ${PROJECT_TYPE == "Auto-detect" ? "Analyze the project structure to identify all technology stacks and frameworks in use by examining:
  - Project and configuration files
  - Package dependencies and import statements
  - Framework-specific patterns and conventions
  - Build and deployment configurations" : "Focus on ${PROJECT_TYPE} specific patterns and practices"}

- ${ARCHITECTURE_PATTERN == "Auto-detect" ? "Determine the architectural pattern(s) by analyzing:
  - Folder organization and namespacing
  - Dependency flow and component boundaries
  - Interface segregation and abstraction patterns
  - Communication mechanisms between components" : "Document how the ${ARCHITECTURE_PATTERN} architecture is implemented"}

### 2. Architectural Overview
- Provide a clear, concise explanation of the overall architectural approach
- Document the guiding principles evident in the architectural choices
- Identify architectural boundaries and how they're enforced
- Note any hybrid architectural patterns or adaptations of standard patterns

### 3. Architecture Visualization
${DIAGRAM_TYPE != "None" ? `Create ${DIAGRAM_TYPE} diagrams at multiple levels of abstraction:
- High-level architectural overview showing major subsystems
- Component interaction diagrams showing relationships and dependencies
- Data flow diagrams showing how information moves through the system
- Ensure diagrams accurately reflect the actual implementation, not theoretical patterns` : "Describe the component relationships based on actual code dependencies, providing clear textual explanations of:
- Subsystem organization and boundaries
- Dependency directions and component interactions
- Data flow and process sequences"}

### 4. Core Architectural Components
For each architectural component discovered in the codebase:

- **Purpose and Responsibility**:
  - Primary function within the architecture
  - Business domains or technical concerns addressed
  - Boundaries and scope limitations

- **Internal Structure**:
  - Organization of classes/modules within the component
  - Key abstractions and their implementations
  - Design patterns utilized

- **Interaction Patterns**:
  - How the component communicates with others
  - Interfaces exposed and consumed
  - Dependency injection patterns
  - Event publishing/subscription mechanisms

- **Evolution Patterns**:
  - How the component can be extended
  - Variation points and plugin mechanisms
  - Configuration and customization approaches

### 5. Architectural Layers and Dependencies
- Map the layer structure as implemented in the codebase
- Document the dependency rules between layers
- Identify abstraction mechanisms that enable layer separation
- Note any circular dependencies or layer violations
- Document dependency injection patterns used to maintain separation

### 6. Data Architecture
- Document domain model structure and organization
- Map entity relationships and aggregation patterns
- Identify data access patterns (repositories, data mappers, etc.)
- Document data transformation and mapping approaches
- Note caching strategies and implementations
- Document data validation patterns

### 7. Cross-Cutting Concerns Implementation
Document implementation patterns for cross-cutting concerns:

- **Authentication & Authorization**
- **Error Handling & Resilience**
- **Logging & Monitoring**
- **Validation**
- **Configuration Management**

### 8. Service Communication Patterns
- Document service boundary definitions
- Identify communication protocols and formats
- Map synchronous vs. asynchronous communication patterns

### 9. Testing Architecture
- Document testing strategies aligned with the architecture
- Identify test boundary patterns (unit, integration, system)
- Map test doubles and mocking approaches

### 10. Deployment Architecture
- Document deployment topology derived from configuration
- Identify environment-specific architectural adaptations
- Map runtime dependency resolution patterns

### 11. Blueprint for New Development
Create a clear architectural guide for implementing new features:

- **Development Workflow**
- **Implementation Templates**
- **Common Pitfalls**

Include information about when this blueprint was generated and recommendations for keeping it updated as the architecture evolves."
